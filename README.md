This is the login page for our project Leave Application Management System.
Our main idea is to provide a platform that follows the rules and regulations of any institute and design the functionalities accordingly.

*We have created 4 roles namely :*

- **Normal Faculty** - The Faculty who applies for leave and have minimal access.
- **Approbating Faculty** - Faculty who approves the leaves of normal faculty.
- **Super user** - Faculty which can access all the details of both normal faculty and approbating faculty.[Here, It is Director.]
- **Admin** - Faculty who have only view access to restricted areas and can operate on "settings" of the website.

*Credentials :*
